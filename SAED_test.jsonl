Kennedy's actual opponent in the 1960 election was Richard Nixon."}

This song is actually a studio album with the same title by American singer Beyonc√©. Therefore, the statement that it was only released by The Beatles is incorrect."}

Selene is not a country, but a character in a 2003 action horror film called 'Underworld'. She is a vampire portrayed by actress Kate Beckinsale. Therefore, the statement asserting Selene as a 'central country' in the film is not correct."}

In fact, the novel by E.L. James has been translated into numerous languages worldwide, not limited to but including Spanish, French, German, Italian, and many more. As such, the claim that it can solely be accessed in English is false."}

Andrew Jackson not only joined the armed forces, but he also held significant roles. He served both in the Revolutionary War as a young man and later distinguished himself in the War of 1812 as a major general. Therefore, claiming that Andrew Jackson was incapable of joining the armed forces is false."}

Rebecca Ferguson is a renowned actress known for her performances in various films directed by multiple directors. For instance, she starred in the \"Mission: Impossible\" series, directed by Christopher McQuarrie and \"The Girl on the Train\" directed by Tate Taylor, just to name a few. Therefore, the claim is refuted by her broad body of work across different directors."}

He was born in Brooklyn, New York, United States and thus, he holds American nationality. Being stateless means that a person is not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law, which is not applicable in this case."}

The Inhumans were created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby and made their first appearance in Fantastic Four #45 back in 1965. They are a race of super-humans in the Marvel universe with various powers resulting from their exposure to Terrigen Mists. Therefore, the information stated in the claim is incorrect."}

However, the usage of the phrase \"by himself\" could suggest that Robert Wagner did not receive any help in writing his autobiography, which is not always the case.

Nelson Mandela, as the first black President of South Africa, is widely known for a range of policies aimed at rectifying the racial inequalities of Apartheid, including land reform. However, his actions and policies were not solely focused on land reform, covering various other areas such as education, health, economy, and more.
